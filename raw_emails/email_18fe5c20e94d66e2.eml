So good to hear from you! No worries regarding the interval. None
whatsoever. So many times I was on the verge of emailing you, the only
thing stopping me being how busy I am. That's not a brag or a complaint.
Simply a statement of fact.

Last I heard about Evan was from my Sister when the three of us visited my
sister and her fiance, Sam at an AirBnB in Holyoke with my parents. Emily
and Sam are engaged! That's some pretty big family news. Maybe Evan told
you. I'm not sure if you ever met Sam. I'm inclined to think not. He's
great! I can't remember if I've described him to you before, I'm inclined
to think so.

My dad did mention that you'd been playing with Evan somewhat regularly,
which makes me happy. I know I can get down on him, but I'll say that he
does have the quality of making everyone around him somewhat musically
active, or at least musically interested, even inspired. That's a good
quality. What you said about the kratom and the withdrawal drug and
subsequent withdrawal aligns with what my sister related, her opinion of
Evan being generally favorable for a change.

I'm genuinely touched by the dedication of your tune to my family. I've
admired your compositional output. I imagine it takes a lot of will and
energy to write and revise them. I can only imagine since I'm not a
composer. I do have a poem I'd like to share, though. It's been through
some revision stages. I've brought it to my poetry workshop twice now and
I've applied some of the useful feedback, definitely for the better. This
poem wasn't written on a wild impulse with no plan in mind, it was a poem
that came from an idea. I wanted to write a creation myth for
consciousness. I love the wordplay in your *Middlemarch *references in the
title of your tune. You are absolutely right, *Middlemarch* just comes up a
lot here and there. And now that *you've *mentioned it, well I think it's
time I take a look. Maybe that will be my summer read! I'm just about to
finish *Things Fall Apart*. I know. How can I have not read that by now? It
was assigned in college but I skipped it. So I read it admittedly in part
due to a latent guilt of an academic and cultural nature having neglected
my assignment all that time ago. This guilt is compounded by the fact that
I was showing around a KP student who was thinking about going to UMASS,
Eric Sigmund's younger brother, his name I forget. Anyway, I took him to a
seminar class, which convened outside that day, and we were discussing *Thi=
ngs
Fall Apart* but I hadn't read it! Though I didn't admit that to anyone in
the seminar, or my guest! But all that doesn't matter because it's a great
book!

I, too, recently met an Australian guy and we talked about Bluey. Your
description of watching children's television resonates deeply with me.
Speaking of which, have you seen *Butterfly in the Sky, *the documentary
about *Reading Rainbow*? It's super nostalgic for obvious reasons. I don't
know if you ever watched *"Rainbow"* as one of the producers calls it, but
I certainly did. I remember it not being my favorite, but definitely a part
of the rotation. I totally forgot they did an episode on the set of TNG,
that blew my mind. Could you imagine another member of the main cast of TNG
doing their other show in the middle of their prime time show? The opening
song slaps. I have imagined it many times as an opening statement to a drum
corps show - I have so many ideas for drum corps shows all the time and
they'll never be realized! How tantalizing. Lush Life sounds genuinely
cool. I try to enjoy drum corps now for what it is.

There was a Jason Bentley post that I found pretty funny. He joked that he
could now make all the Cadets merch he wanted and not get sued because they
don't, and as you point out can never again, exist. I was shocked but not
surprised, if that's possible. Not just George Hopkins but some other guy
named Voght, not sure if that's spelled correctly. Yes, these crimes
destroyed the Cadets. Their 2022 show is a fitting farewell as it's one of
those greatest hits shows. I'm sure I told you the story of my sister's
joke about Cadets '08 where they did a greatest hits tag ending to West
Side Story, Emily said it was like the Cadets' funeral, well 2022 even
moreso, even though they didn't finally disappear until 2024. I felt really
bad for Stan. That guy is a bonafide drum corps legend. It looked like
teaching at Cadets was a big part of his life. That was the biggest lament
- that it wasn't fair that the whole organization should be punished for
the crimes of two people, one being the director and a powerful figure in
the drum corps world. There is a part of me that feels like I am part of an
exclusive club now that they don't exist, even though I know that's weird.
I was wearing my Cadets jacket a lot in the fall. It's good for the
weather. I'm sure it means nothing to the people in that part of the Bronx.
Though, I saw something on the Cadets Facebook alumni page about having a
rehearsal in the Kingsbridge Armory which is across the street from my
school and I'd really like to verify that. Drum corps is so niche the
documentation is not robust enough to stand the test of time, it dissolves
to lore.

That jazz app sounds pretty cool. I'll check it out when I get a chance.
Not much else going on for me over here. Joanna is going to have a little
"stepping up" ceremony to mark the end of 3K. My own school year is
wrapping up. I won't get into detail about work but a while back I was at
something of a crossroads: 1. keep my head down and just worry about my
classes and not meddle in school-wide affairs, or 2. try to wield influence
to make change in the professional development and policies at the school
in an attempt to improve things for teachers. Hiring is dire. It's almost
impossible to find candidates at all let alone select one. I feel that some
of the expectations make the job too hard for most people and that's why
they leave. Anyway I took the second choice, maybe foolishly. So far I've
made a lot of progress along those lines. I developed a literacy assessment
system that I'm hesitantly excited about. I'll make an effort to tell you
more about it. I even had the new English teacher over for dinner at
Christina's suggestion to try to make her feel valued and part of the
school community. I hope she stays because she's pretty good and last year
the 10th grade English teacher quit before Halloween and all of my current
students had a long-term sub last year who did absolutely nothing with them
so they have no knowledge of literary elements or anything, something the
kids I used to get actually did know to varying degrees because we used to
have a really good 10th grade English teacher names Sally who left to go to
a better school.

I'll be up in Norfolk mid-July, the 15th and some days after. We should get
together!

<div dir=3D"ltr">So good to hear from you! No worries regarding the interva=
l. None whatsoever. So many times I was on the verge of emailing you, the o=
nly thing stopping me being how busy I am. That&#39;s not a brag or a compl=
aint. Simply a statement of fact.=C2=A0<div><br></div><div>Last I heard abo=
ut Evan was from my Sister when the three of us visited my sister and her f=
iance, Sam at an AirBnB in Holyoke with my parents. Emily and Sam are engag=
ed! That&#39;s some pretty big family news. Maybe Evan told you. I&#39;m no=
t sure if you ever met Sam. I&#39;m inclined to think not. He&#39;s great! =
I can&#39;t remember=C2=A0if I&#39;ve described him to you before, I&#39;m =
inclined to think so.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>My dad did mention tha=
t you&#39;d been playing with Evan somewhat regularly, which makes me happy=
. I know I can get down on him, but I&#39;ll say that he does have the qual=
ity of making everyone around him somewhat musically active, or at least mu=
sically interested, even inspired. That&#39;s a good quality. What you said=
 about the kratom and the withdrawal=C2=A0drug and subsequent=C2=A0withdraw=
al=C2=A0aligns with what my sister related, her opinion of Evan being gener=
ally favorable for a change.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m genuine=
ly touched by the dedication of your tune to my family. I&#39;ve admired yo=
ur compositional output. I imagine it takes a lot of will and energy to wri=
te and revise them. I can only imagine since I&#39;m not a composer. I do h=
ave a poem I&#39;d like to share, though. It&#39;s been through some revisi=
on stages. I&#39;ve brought it to my poetry workshop twice now and I&#39;ve=
 applied some of the useful feedback, definitely for the better. This poem =
wasn&#39;t written on a wild impulse with no plan in mind, it was a poem th=
at came from an idea. I wanted to write a creation myth for consciousness. =
I love the wordplay in your <i>Middlemarch </i>references in the title of y=
our tune. You are absolutely right,=C2=A0<i>Middlemarch</i>=C2=A0just comes=
 up a lot here and there. And now that <i>you&#39;ve </i>mentioned it, well=
 I think it&#39;s time I take a look. Maybe that will be my summer read! I&=
#39;m just about to finish <i>Things Fall Apart</i>. I know. How can I have=
 not read that by now? It was assigned in college but I skipped it. So I re=
ad it admittedly in part due to a latent guilt of an academic and cultural =
nature having neglected my assignment all that time ago. This guilt is comp=
ounded by the fact that I was showing around a KP student who was thinking =
about going to UMASS, Eric Sigmund&#39;s younger brother, his name I=C2=A0f=
orget. Anyway, I took him to a seminar class, which convened outside that d=
ay, and we were discussing <i>Things Fall Apart</i>=C2=A0but I hadn&#39;t r=
ead it! Though I didn&#39;t admit that to anyone in the seminar, or my gues=
t! But all that doesn&#39;t matter because it&#39;s a great book!=C2=A0=C2=
=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I, too, recently met an Australian guy and we =
talked about Bluey. Your description of watching children&#39;s television =
resonates deeply with me. Speaking of which, have you seen <i>Butterfly in =
the Sky, </i>the documentary about <i>Reading Rainbow</i>? It&#39;s super n=
ostalgic for obvious reasons. I don&#39;t know if you ever watched <i>&quot=
;Rainbow&quot;</i>=C2=A0as one of the producers calls it, but I certainly d=
id. I remember it not being my favorite, but definitely a part of the rotat=
ion. I totally forgot they did an episode on the set of TNG, that blew my m=
ind. Could you imagine another member of the main cast of TNG doing their o=
ther show in the middle of their prime time show? The opening song slaps. I=
 have imagined it many times as an opening statement to a drum corps show -=
 I have so many ideas for drum corps shows all the time and they&#39;ll nev=
er be realized! How tantalizing. Lush Life sounds genuinely cool. I try to =
enjoy drum corps now for what it is.=C2=A0</div><div><i><br></i></div><div>=
There was a Jason Bentley post that I found pretty funny. He joked that he =
could now make all the Cadets merch he wanted and not get sued because they=
 don&#39;t, and as you point out can never again, exist. I was shocked but =
not surprised, if that&#39;s possible. Not just George Hopkins but some oth=
er guy named Voght, not sure if that&#39;s spelled correctly. Yes, these cr=
imes destroyed the Cadets. Their 2022 show is a fitting farewell as it&#39;=
s one of those greatest hits shows. I&#39;m sure I told you the story of my=
 sister&#39;s joke about Cadets &#39;08 where they did a greatest hits tag =
ending to West Side Story, Emily said it was like the Cadets&#39; funeral, =
well 2022 even moreso, even though they didn&#39;t finally disappear until =
2024. I felt really bad for Stan. That guy is a bonafide drum corps legend.=
 It looked like teaching at Cadets was a big part of his life. That was the=
 biggest lament - that it wasn&#39;t fair that the whole organization shoul=
d be punished for the crimes of two people, one being the director and a po=
werful figure in the drum corps world. There is a part of me that feels lik=
e I am part of an exclusive club now that they don&#39;t exist, even though=
 I know that&#39;s weird. I was wearing my Cadets jacket a lot in the fall.=
 It&#39;s good for the weather. I&#39;m sure it means nothing to the people=
 in that part of the Bronx. Though, I saw something on the Cadets Facebook =
alumni page about having a rehearsal in the Kingsbridge Armory which is acr=
oss the street from my school and I&#39;d really like to verify that. Drum =
corps is so niche the documentation is not robust enough to stand the test =
of time, it dissolves to lore.</div><div><i><br></i></div><div>That jazz ap=
p sounds pretty cool. I&#39;ll check it out when I get a chance. Not much e=
lse going on for me over here. Joanna is going to have a little &quot;stepp=
ing up&quot; ceremony to mark the end of 3K. My own school year is wrapping=
 up. I won&#39;t get into detail about work but a while back I was at somet=
hing of a crossroads: 1. keep my head down and just worry about my classes =
and not meddle in school-wide affairs, or 2. try to wield influence to make=
 change in the professional development and policies at the school in an at=
tempt to improve things for teachers. Hiring is dire. It&#39;s almost impos=
sible to find candidates at all let alone select one. I feel that some of t=
he expectations make the job too hard for most people and that&#39;s why th=
ey leave. Anyway I took the second choice, maybe foolishly. So far I&#39;ve=
 made a lot of progress along those lines. I developed a literacy assessmen=
t system that I&#39;m hesitantly excited about. I&#39;ll make an effort to =
tell you more about it. I even had the new English teacher over for dinner =
at Christina&#39;s suggestion to try to make her feel valued and part of th=
e school community. I hope she stays because she&#39;s pretty good and last=
 year the 10th grade English teacher quit before Halloween and all of my cu=
rrent students had a long-term sub last year who did absolutely nothing wit=
h them so they have no knowledge of literary elements or anything, somethin=
g the kids I used to get actually did know to varying degrees because we us=
ed to have a really good 10th grade English teacher names Sally who left to=
 go to a better school.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ll be up in No=
rfolk mid-July, the 15th and some days after. We should get together!</div>=

I hope the interval between this email and my next is much shorter than the=

 have a regular Sunday time which works out nice because I bring Toby to my=
 parents&#39; and they watch him for a couple hours which I think is about =
their limit and everyone gets a break. That keeps me sticking with Evan in =
spite of other difficulties, well that and my loyalty to him as I see him a=
s chiefly responsible for my reaching the level I have in jazz. I had gotte=
n to wherever I&#39;d gotten through high school and college and then our i=
ntensive playing in 2011-12 not only upgraded my jazz playing but set me on=
 my motivated jazz course for the next 10+ years. For awhile we were consis=
tent every week but things broke off when Evan started kicking kratom, whic=
h I&#39;m not sure if you know about. He says it&#39;s basically an opiate =
and he was taking some kind of withdrawal drug, maybe methadone, which he i=
n turn had to wean himself off of, often leaving him too ill to play. Now h=
e&#39;s off the withdrawal drug as well but not out of the woods as I guess=
 there&#39;s still weeks of depression, anxiety, fatigue, listlessness.=C2=
=A0This past Sunday he was only able to play two tunes on drums. Afterwards=
 I went for a walk in the airport conservation area, which I hadn&#39;t bee=
n to, and even blew some soprano right at the edge of the=C2=A0swamp. It wa=
s cool, it had a big echoing sound and=C2=A0I was playing kinda modal but w=
ith chromatic interpolations, always ending on a low C. But then I heard a =
dog barking and got self-conscious and stopped. I know we&#39;ve talked abo=
ut how many issues I&#39;ve had disturbing people with my playing which mak=
es it difficult in those kinds of situations. If I was in your neck of the =
woods I could just go out on the Williamsburg Bridge! Probably a little pre=
sumptuous. The week before, though, was a good sesh, instead of just doing =
drums like he normally does he played some bass and piano which are nice fo=
r me variety-wise plus I could hop on the drums when he did piano. Another =
reason to stick with it is the uncertainty and difficulty and time and effo=
rt it would take to find other people to play with which I can&#39;t imagin=
e fitting into my life right now, whereas Evan is &#39;reliable&#39; in the=
 sense of, if he is available it&#39;s easy to set up and there&#39;s littl=
e awkwardness, we know each other etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Also he fin=
ally played me the Emily songs which you mentioned awhile=C2=A0back! Oh man=
, I just asked kind of polite questions about some of the formal aspects an=
d I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t ask for my opinion outright. But it was like y=
ou said. Recently I did go through his whole Soundcloud and give him feedba=
ck, which was that the later improvised stuff with Andy is pretty monotonou=
s but the earlier stuff with more harmonic and textural and instrumental va=
riety has a lot that I like. And I think it made an impression on him, beca=
use he was talking about listening to two of his albums, and how on the old=
er one he was putting all his jazz stuff into it, not so much the later one=
s. So there seems to be some awareness, I just don&#39;t know what he&#39;s=
 thinking with the Emily stuff, and his jazz playing is always relatively t=
asteful and idiomatic though I guess maybe it wasn&#39;t at WP which we&#39=
;ve discussed.<br><div><br></div><div>I have two new tunes, both in a state=
 of stubborn and frustrating non-completeness. They are both mostly done bu=
t have little gaps to be filled in. One of them manifested and came togethe=
r, the A section at least, very shortly after your last visit and is in fac=
t dedicated to or about you, well your family. The title is currently &quot=
;mjc back to the city,&quot; we&#39;ll see if that sticks. And I hope to be=
 able to share it with you at some point. It&#39;s a little unwieldy in tha=
t form is quite long, AABA but the A is 20 bars and the B is 16, and then t=
he last A has a little tag. The other one is called &quot;miss brooke&quot;=
 and was inspired by my reading of <i>Middlemarch</i>, have you read that? =
I&#39;m about halfway through now. I had never read any Eliot and in genera=
l I&#39;m not big on 19th century novels outside of certain authors, but I =
had seen this being mentioned lots of places and gave it a look and don&#39=
;t regret it at all. I love the long sentences, it&#39;s funny and vital an=
d interesting and deep and broad. If you haven&#39;t read it, one of the ma=
jor characters and I guess the protagonist of the first part of the book is=
 Dorothea Brooke, and she has a younger sister Celia, and the book or secti=
on or whatever is called Miss Brooke. You may or may not also know that Bud=
 Powell has a tune, Celia, that I&#39;ve played quite a bit, and this is ge=
tting pretty convoluted but at least from my perspective it made perfect in=
tuitive sense that I should then write a tune on Bud&#39;s Celia changes na=
med after Dorothea Brooke, which I&#39;ve done except for four refractory b=
ars. It is or will be my favorite tune I&#39;ve written (by which I mean no=
 slight to mjc). So that&#39;s another one hopefully you&#39;ll hear soon, =
and definitely consider Middlemarch if you haven&#39;t before though it&#39=
;s quite a beast at 800 or so pages. I&#39;m taking my time with it. Actual=
ly one of the things I wanted to text you was a photo of an excerpt but, we=
ll maybe next time!</div></div><div><br></div><div>Did you ever manage to c=
heck out that movie First Reformed? No worries if not but I would be very v=
ery interested to hear your take on it should you have a chance.</div><div>=
<br></div><div>We&#39;ve been watching a lot of kids TV. Well not a ton but=
 it accumulates. Sesame Street is pretty solid as I remember you indicating=
. I especially like some of the R&amp;B inflections in the number of the da=
y and letter of the day songs (the astronaut one and the one sung by Elmo).=
 The astronaut counting sequence may be Toby&#39;s favorite, he likes to si=
ng along with ah-ah ah-ah in staaaaar. I could go for maybe 30% less Elmo. =
Bluey is another favorite, I like when they do formally ambitious things li=
ke the episode that&#39;s all in Facetime and they keep adding more screens=
. I was even able to successfully apply knowledge from Bluey in a conversat=
ion I had with an Australian guy! I was saying something about landscapers =
and he looked confused and then I supplied &quot;tradeys&quot; and he was i=
mpressed, he said, &quot;how do you know so much of my culture?&quot; And t=
hen we do the Miyazaki films that are appropriate for very young kids: My N=
eighbor Totoro, Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service, and Ponyo. I don&#39;t seem to=
 get sick of any of those, and Totoro in particular I think might be a legi=
t classic of world cinema. Watching these really got me thinking about the =
intentionality of animation, specifically hand-drawn animation. If we were =
making a movie and I was filming you outside and the wind blew your hair a =
little that would just happen, or it wouldn&#39;t, and it would be part of =
the scene. But in a cartoon movie that little breeze was willed and designe=
d by somebody, and painstakingly implemented. So many tiny details going by=
 so fast.</div><div><br></div><div>The Crossmen are doing a Lush Life show!=
 I know it will be bad but at least they are playing mostly good music, Bil=
ly Strayhorn and Miles and Monk. And maybe just maybe it will be good, but =
who am I kidding. The show announcement video is well-done even if they see=
m to misinterpret the lyrics, right when Johnny Hartman sings &quot;Romance=
...&quot; they do a montage of all these unironic romantic shots, even as h=
e continues &quot;...is a mush stifling all who strive; I&#39;ll live a lus=
h life in some small dive.&quot; It&#39;s a weird coincidence as I&#39;d ju=
st been learning that tune when I saw the show announcement. The lyrics are=
 a tad purple but overall I think the best and most interesting lyrics to a=
ny jazz standard, there&#39;s lots of internal rhyme. And of course any tho=
ught of the Crossmen leads inevitably to the vanished &#39;dets, I assume y=
ou saw they haven&#39;t just folded but are somehow eternally barred from e=
ver existing again? Something about how any organization using the Cadets n=
ame would be liable for all of George Hopkins&#39; crimes.</div><div><br></=
div><div>Techwise one of the projects I&#39;ve been working on is a jazz re=
pertoire management app. It&#39;s live on the web, I&#39;d love it if you c=
ould make an account and try it out. Though it might not be very useful to =
you. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s the same with Evan, you&#39;d think he&#39;d =
be a natural choice but he&#39;s pretty indifferent to repertoire these day=
s. The idea is it lets you track your repertoire, crucially when you last p=
layed a tune, to help keep you from forgetting tunes. I&#39;ve been using i=
t every day and it&#39;s been pretty helpful,=C2=A0I know how many tunes I =
know and I can see how well I&#39;m doing hitting all of them in regular pr=
actice. When I first started using Linux back in the day I was so amazed th=
at there was all this software out there for free in the world just because=
 someone decided to make and share it. Some of it is things a lot of people=
 use every day but then there&#39;s also weird niche things like this. I&#3=
9;m proud to have made what I think is a useful contribution to that space.=
 I haven&#39;t been working on it actively for a little while but will come=
 back to it, I want to add a &#39;tune analytics&#39; section where you can=
 see graphs and whatnot of your most-played tunes over different timespans,=
 as well as more advanced search and display features. Anyway, it&#39;s at=
=C2=A0<a href=3D"https://jazztunes.org/" target=3D"_blank">https://jazztune=
s.org/</a> .=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ll stop there for now, oh=
 one other thing in this book that was mostly about Manet, maybe a very tri=
te observation but I found it profound, that from the Renaissance through t=
o the birth of modernism looking at a painting was supposed to be looking i=
nto a little room, into a three-dimensional space you could dream in. But t=
hen the modernists starting obliquely with Manet as their grandfather disru=
pted this by treating the canvas as a flat plane, a surface that resists yo=
u or even looks back at you to a certain extent? So you don&#39;t dream in =
it, you confront it and/or it confronts you.=C2=A0<i>The Luncheon on the Gr=
ass </i>was a big turning point. The book was <i>After the Beautiful</i>=C2=
=A0by Terry Pinkard.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Okay hope you&#39;re al=
