So just to set you (somewhat) at ease, this email account is intact and I
don't think I've ever gone through deleting things, certainly not from you.
I just checked and it goes back to 2006. I think this is my first gmail
account, or at least I don't remember having another before it. That said
after a glance at our earliest exchanges they do seem to start in medias
res, or maybe there's some missing ones, and of course some of them are
gchats which are a pain. Like my very first email here is emailing a friend
about a Boris show in Boston in 2006. I don't remember it at all but that
doesn't seem right?

I think it's possible that we emailed using my Colorado College email
before I switched over to this one, and those would have to be considered
lost. Or maybe we didn't email very much before then? I know we used to
chat on AIM a lot.

Anyway 2006-present is still a lot of content, probably the vast majority
of it. My reasoning being the earliest we likely would've started sending
emails would be when I went to college in 03.

I have a friend who used to work at Google and will ask him if there's any
possibility of recovering your emails and/or ways to analyze accounts so as
to see if I'm missing anything for mysterious reasons.

Funny coincidence, as I write this gmail is  nagging me with a popup, 92%
of storage used, if I run out, I can't send emails. Maybe I should delete
some to make room! just kidding lol

On a more serious note I should look into backing up all our emails given
their newly emphasized tenuosity, that's definitely something I can figure
out how to do.

Your latest poem is really good as in the best thing you've written that
I've seen and I've been meaning to write to you about it but I'll just say
that for now.

We should definitely meet up during the time you're back around, I'll talk
to Lisa about maybe meeting here but then also we should play some music
with Evan.

Did you see about the oldest confirmed cave art being in Indonesia, in
Sulawesi in particular, 51000 BP? I don't know about this specific example
but all the previous really old cave paintings have been in the region of
Maros, which is close to Makassar. If you go from Makassar to Toraja by car
(as we used to often do and likely will again unless taking the ferry from
Balikpapan which deposits you at Parepare, the entryway to the highlands),
you pass right through Maros as in it's the very first region after
Makassar itself. I've known about these cave paintings for awhile and have
often idly expressed to Lisa my desire at some point to check them out as I
think it would be totally feasible to do so even without any government or
academic authorization. But now I think the next time we are there I'll
insist we take an extra day to go see them.

ok talk soon
