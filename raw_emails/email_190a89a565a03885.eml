Sorry for just getting back to you. We would love to stay for dinner if
it's not too imposing, so probably coming sometime in the afternoon and
then leaving after dinner. Lisa will doubtless want to bring some kind of
appetizer/snack. Toby loves water so I'm sure he would enjoying seeing the
Lake. Current forecast shows hot and sunny!

As for music, I do have a cornet gathering dust in the ol' pumphouse, if it
seems like I can get the valves moving I will bring it along. Because why
not have all the options right? Evan tried to cancel our session this past
Sunday but I kind of gently insisted and we ended up playing three tunes.
So I bet he'll be down to play at least a little bit, and if not we can do
duets and/or stuff on the piano. I finished Miss Brooke which I want to
show you.

So if I don't hear from you before then I'll be in touch on Sunday to give
you an ETA!
