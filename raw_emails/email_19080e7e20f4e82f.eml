Jeff, I hope you are well. I am writing you from Norfolk actually. Headed up=
 to Maine tomorrow for a family vacation. I=E2=80=99ll be in Norfolk again f=
or a few days after our trip. That would be the 12th-15th or so. It=E2=80=99=
s a bit short notice but we=E2=80=99d love to say hi sometime then, either i=
n Norwood or Norfolk. We will be back up in Massachusetts in August if we ar=
en=E2=80=99t able to get together in July.=20

I made possibly a terribly consequential mistake tonight that was careless a=
nd avoidable. In clearing out my gmail inbox and then subsequently clearing o=
ut the trash folder as I routinely do, I somehow accidentally cleared out my=
 =E2=80=9Call mail=E2=80=9D folder, and then again from the trash folder. In=
 doing so I accidentally deleted all our emails over the years, which I had i=
ntended to someday archive more permanently, even to compile them all in one=
 file.=20

It would bring a great deal of relief even just to know whether you still ha=
ve our emails archived. That is both emails sent from me to you, and more im=
portantly, from you to me. I had considered our correspondence to be not jus=
t a chronicle of our friendship, but indeed the most intact account of my li=
fe. Needless to say I was distraught and embarrassed by my error. I=E2=80=99=
d hate to think it was all lost.=20

My hope is you have our correspondence, or some amount of it, and that it is=
 not lost. If that=E2=80=99s the case, it would again bring great relief to k=
now you still had them. If you do, then perhaps it would be possible at some=
 future time of your convenience to forward them to me so I might finally go=
 about preserving them more permanently - eventually in the form of physical=
 copies for you and myself.=20

My apologies for the somewhat random and jarring nature of this email. Hopef=
ully I have not caused such a great loss.=20

As I grappled with the possibility of such a consequential error, I attempte=
d to console myself with ideas we=E2=80=99ve talked about and probably recor=
ded well enough - the nature of impermanence, radical detachment and stoicis=
m in the face of such events, but above all, the understanding that our frie=
ndship, indeed our lives are much more than our emails and that the memories=
 cannot be lost so easily. Apologies for the melodrama. Thanks in advance fo=
r your reply and what matters most is that you and your family are happy and=
 healthy.=20

You=E2=80=99re the best, Jeff. Thank you for being such a great friend all t=
hese years.=20=
