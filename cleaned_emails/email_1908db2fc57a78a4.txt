UMASS will close down my email account sometime soon so I wanted to  
let you know to send all future emails to msbutler05@gmail.com

I've been cruising through ds9 lately and I'm pretty much done with  
the first season. There was one I couldn't watch because the link was  
broken or something (I've been streaming most of the video's) and  
chose to skip "If Wishes Were Horse" because the idea of physical  
manifestations of thoughts has been done (I think maybe even twice) in  
TNG and definitely once in TOS.

i'm really enjoying the character development on the show, and the  
development of the ferengi as a species.

More on DS9 to come
