Sunday works great! I don’t have my trumpet but I can play piano or maybe drums. Evan can play anything of course, but sadly I can’t guarantee his participation. He seemed pretty depressed the other day when we were there, but my hope is he’ll join. Also, and this might be too ambitious, but Toby and others may enjoy splashing around in Kingsbury Pond, weather permitting if you’d like to do that too. But yes Sunday works very well. Anytime! Just let me know if you’d like to stay for dinner also so we can cook. 

And again, my deepest appreciation! You managed to automate a project that I thought would take me many hours. I won’t try to open these files on my smart phone but I can’t wait to open and read them when I get back home. Thank you. I’d love to hear about how you did that when we meet up. See you Sunday!

This would have some advantages for us, one being that I would like Toby to have the chance to see me playing music with other people in an 'authentic' setting. This would work best if we could meet on Sunday the 14th, as that's a day when Evan is generally available, whereas it's usually not the case with Saturdays.
