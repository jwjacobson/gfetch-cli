How would you feel about meeting at Chez Butler over the weekend? This
would have some advantages for us, one being that I would like Toby to have
the chance to see me playing music with other people in an 'authentic'
setting. This would work best if we could meet on Sunday the 14th, as
that's a day when Evan is generally available, whereas it's usually not the
case with Saturdays.

Would that work? Let me know either way, or text at 617 331 3817
