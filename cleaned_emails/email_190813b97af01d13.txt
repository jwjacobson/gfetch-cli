So just to set you (somewhat) at ease, this email account is intact and I
don't think I've ever gone through deleting things, certainly not from you.
I just checked and it goes back to 2006. I think this is my first gmail
account, or at least I don't remember having another before it. That said
after a glance at our earliest exchanges they do seem to start in medias
res, or maybe there's some missing ones, and of course some of them are
gchats which are a pain. Like my very first email here is emailing a friend
about a Boris show in Boston in 2006. I don't remember it at all but that
doesn't seem right?

I think it's possible that we emailed using my Colorado College email
before I switched over to this one, and those would have to be considered
lost. Or maybe we didn't email very much before then? I know we used to
chat on AIM a lot.

Anyway 2006-present is still a lot of content, probably the vast majority
of it. My reasoning being the earliest we likely would've started sending
emails would be when I went to college in 03.

I have a friend who used to work at Google and will ask him if there's any
possibility of recovering your emails and/or ways to analyze accounts so as
to see if I'm missing anything for mysterious reasons.

Funny coincidence, as I write this gmail is  nagging me with a popup, 92%
of storage used, if I run out, I can't send emails. Maybe I should delete
some to make room! just kidding lol
