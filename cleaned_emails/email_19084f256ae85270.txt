First of all, this link may help you restore your emails:

https://support.google.com/mail/workflow/9317561?rd=1&sjid=17917631426869538484-NA&visit_id=638558113604631772-3962861501

Secondly, I have downloaded what should be all our emails from my account.
I did this via the Gmail API and I am sending them to you now in a very
rough form: each individual email is a .eml file which you can open with a
text editor. Most of each file is all kinds of metadata but the body of the
email is clearly formatted plaintext. You may have to scroll down a bit to
find it especially if the email had any attachments. The emails are
compressed and then wrapped in a tar archive which your computer should be
able to handle but let me know if you have trouble.

Further steps I'll eventually look into are cleaning up the files to make
them more readable. Also apparently the API supports retrieving the emails
as "threads" (chains of emails) rather than individual emails, which could
be useful.

The other thing I haven't done is any sort of testing to confirm that all
the emails have really been retrieved. I can tell you how many it is
though: 1163! That number looks about right. Can you imagine how laborious
and prone to error it would've been to forward these to you one by one via
the Gmail interface? Although maybe I can forward with the API too...

Note: these are all the emails exchanged with msbutler05@gmail.com but I
just noticed that for awhile you were still using your Umass email so I
will need to get those as well.

So consider this maybe a proof of concept for email backup/retrieval--
